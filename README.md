# Turso-Cloudflare Workers REST API

This is a distributed REST API built using [Cloudflare workers] and [Turso] with [Drizzle] used as the ORM.

## Database Setup

[Install the Turso CLI].

Create a new turso database.

```sh
turso db create the-mugs-store-api
```

> **Note**
>
> We use `the-mugs-store-api` as the database name in this command, but you can give
> it any name.

To access the data stored inside your database, you need the Turso database url and an authentication token.

To obtain the database url, run the following command:

```sh
turso db show the-mugs-store-api --url
```

And, to create an authentication token for your database, run:

```sh
turso db tokens create the-mugs-store-api
```

## For local development

Add a `.env` file at the root of the project and inside it add the database url and authentication token for your Turso database obtained in the previous step, these variables will be used to assist in database migration with Drizzle.

```
DATABASE_URL = <DB-URL>
DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN=<AUTH-TOKEN>
```

## Generate database schema, run migrations, and seed data

To generate the schema for the API database, run `npm run generate` which will create a new `/migrations` directory under the `/drizzle` directory.

Next, run `npm run migrate` to apply the migrations on the created Turso database.

And lastly, seed the database with some data by running `npm run seed`.

Run `npm run start` to start the development server.

## For the production environment

Run `npx wrangler secret put TURSO_DB_AUTH_TOKEN` and fill in the auth token acquired above when prompted to add it as a secret variable to your workers project and Cloudflare dashboard.

## Deployment

If you don't have an account, then [create a Cloudflare account here]. After verifying your email address, run `npx wrangler login` on your project's workspace to authenticate it with Cloudflare workers.

Lastly, deploy your Cloudflare workers project by running `npx wrangler deploy src/indes.ts`.
